# ⚡ TIMCODE

> **No Cloud. No Delay. Just Intelligence — Local and Alive.**

TIMCODE is an **AI-powered local code reviewer** designed to redefine how developers interact with AI.  
It shifts from cloud dependency to complete **self-hosted freedom**, allowing developers to run powerful AI review systems **directly on their machine** — offline, private, and blazing fast.

---

## 🚀 Mission
TIMCODE’s mission is to **reshape the future of AI-assisted development** by empowering developers with total control.  
No API limits, no data leaks — just **pure intelligence optimized for your local environment**.  

It represents the next wave of **personal AI tooling**, where your assistant:
- Lives entirely on your system  
- Adapts to your coding style  
- Enhances precision, creativity, and speed

## 💡 Core Philosophy
> “Code should be reviewed by intelligence — not dependency.”

TIMCODE is not just a tool.  
It’s a **statement of independence** — every developer deserves an AI that works *for them*, not *through the cloud*.
